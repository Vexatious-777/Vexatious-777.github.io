I'm a Computer Science graduate (April 2025) actively seeking my first professional role in software development, IT, or anything within the Technology Business Sphere. Really at the end of the day I am just looking for my niche after graduating. Whatever position I find myself in will be the one I plan on throwing myself at with abandon until I have a career path to follow. I'm passionate about technology and constantly expanding my skills to tackle new challenges.
